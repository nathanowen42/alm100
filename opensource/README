All build scrpts are compatable with Ubuntu 15.04
Other dirstros may require modifications to build scripts

Before running build scrpts, run setup_build_environment.sh script to install required packages

Each folder contains
1. A git submodule from the opensource provider
2. A build script which at minimal makes the output binarys
3. A release script which takes output and places it in releases folder
4. A configuration folder containing configurations for submodlues

When upgrading submodule you must run with the defconfig option and then edit the config as needed.

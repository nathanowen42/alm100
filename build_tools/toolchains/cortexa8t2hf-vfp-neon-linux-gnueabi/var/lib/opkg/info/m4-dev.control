Description: Traditional Unix macro processor - Development files
 GNU m4 is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor.  It
 is mostly SVR4 compatible although it has some extensions (for example,
 handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros). GNU M4 also has
 built-in functions for including files, running shell commands, doing
 arithmetic, etc.  This package contains symbolic links, header files, and
 related items necessary for software development.

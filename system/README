All build scrpts are compatable with Ubuntu 15.04
Other dirstros may require modifications to build scripts

Before running build scrpts, run setup_build_environment.sh script to install required packages

Included Scripts:

build_kernel.sh - clones and builds the latest stable kernel relase (by default from ti's repo, also works with kernel.org's repo)
build_uboot.sh - clones and builds the latest ti uboot
